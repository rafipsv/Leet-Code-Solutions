## ✨ Problem Statement

**Problem: Simple Age Output**

> Write a program that reads an integer representing an age from the input and then prints a statement indicating "My age is: " followed by the entered age.

---

## ✅ Example

### Example 1

```
Input: 25
Output: My age is: 25
```

### Example 2

```
Input: 10
Output: My age is: 10
```

---

## 💡 Constraints

- The input will always be a single integer.
- The integer will represent a valid age (typically a non-negative value, though the code doesn't explicitly enforce this).

## ⚡ Approach Explanation

### 🧠 Intuition

The goal is straightforward: take an integer input from the user and then display it back in a specific format. This involves declaring an **integer variable** to store the age, reading the input into that variable, and then using a **print statement** to combine a fixed string with the variable's value.

---

## 💻 My Solution

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int age; // Declare an integer variable named 'age'
  cin >> age; // Read an integer from the input and store it in 'age'
  cout << "My age is: " << age; // Print the fixed string and the value of 'age'
  return 0; // Indicate successful program execution
}
```

---

## 📝 Explanation of My Solution

### Step 1️⃣ — Include Headers and Namespace

I include `<bits/stdc++.h>` for standard library functions and use `using namespace std;` for convenience, making it easier to use `cin` and `cout`.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
```

---

### Step 2️⃣ — Declare Integer Variable

An **integer variable** named `age` is declared. This variable will hold the numerical value of the age entered by the user.

```cpp
int age;
```

---

### Step 3️⃣ — Read Input

The `cin >> age;` statement reads an integer value from the standard input (usually the keyboard) and assigns it to the `age` variable.

```cpp
cin >> age;
```

---

### Step 4️⃣ — Print Output

The `cout << "My age is: " << age;` statement prints the output. It first prints the literal string "My age is: ", and then it prints the current value stored in the `age` variable. The `<<` operator is used to chain these outputs together.

```cpp
cout << "My age is: " << age;
```

---

### Step 5️⃣ — Return 0

`return 0;` signals that the program has executed successfully.

```cpp
return 0;
```

---

## ✅ Summary

- The problem is to read an age and print it in a specific format.
- My solution uses a basic **integer variable** for storage and standard **input/output operations** (`cin` and `cout`) to achieve this.
- It demonstrates fundamental C++ programming concepts like variable declaration and data display.
